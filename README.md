# Ecommerce Website

I created this e-commerce project, and it's a bit of a learning journey for me as it is a complex website. The website isn't super fancy, but it's got the basics covered. I'm using plain ol' JavaScript, trying to understand the ropes without relying on those new frameworks. It's a bit challenging, but I'm working on making things interactive. It's all part of the learning process, and I'm taking it one step at a time, bugs and all.

- View the optimal layout for each of the website's pages depending on their device's screen size

## Built with:
- HTML
